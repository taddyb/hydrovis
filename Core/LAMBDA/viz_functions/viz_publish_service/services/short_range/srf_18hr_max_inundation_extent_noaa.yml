summary: Short-Range 18 Hour Maximum Inundation Extent Forecast
description: "Depicts the inundation extent of the peak National Water Model (NWM)
  streamflow forecast over the next 18 hours where the NWM is signaling high water.
  This service is derived from the short-range configuration of the NWM over the contiguous
  U.S. Shown are reaches with peak flow at or above high water thresholds. High water
  thresholds (regionally varied) and AEPs were derived using the 40-year NWM v3.0
  reanalysis simulation.\n\nSRC Skill: Depicts USGS sites that have an official rating
  curve, symbolized by the \"skill\" of the synthetic rating curve compared to the
  official USGS rating curve. Each point is symbolized by the mean difference in Water
  Surface Elevation (WSE) between the two curves. \n\nEstimated Impacted Buildings:
  Depicts building footprints that intersect inundation extents. The source of the
  building data is the FEMA USA Structures dataset: https://gis-fema.hub.arcgis.com/pages/usa-structures
  (as of August, 2022). Occupancy type data is only available for AL, CA, FL, GA,
  LA, MS, NC, SC, TX, and VA at this time. Also shown are a relative density heatmap
  of potentially impacted buildings (based on extent), county, and HUC level summary
  layers. \n\nEstimated Impacted Critical Infrastructure: Depicts colleges, 
  fire stations, hospitals, nursing homes, police stations, and schools
  that intersect inundation extents. The critical infrastructure data is derived
  from the static FEMA Infrastructure dataset.\n\nUpdated hourly.
  \n\nThis service is for internal use only for NOAA employees and requires access to view.  
  Please do not share externally without prior approval from OWP as this 
  service is experimental and undergoing regular developmental changes.
